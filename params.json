We need to do something to help against climate change.\r\n\r\nOne very good solution for keeping CO2 from getting in to the atmosphere is plating trees. But it is not just planting a tree that helps, is making it grow and know what tree species are good for your community.\r\n\r\nOur solution uses NASA's data to show why this is important and how you can help, by correlating temperature and CO2 emitions through time and how planting and growing trees helps. Then it shows users what tree species are good for planting in the community they live in, and for the different purpose they want it (enhance scenery, habitat for animals, reduce carbon footprint, etc.) It then shows an itinerary of steps to make that tree grow and gives points as rewards for achieving each step.\r\n\r\nOn the community section of our solution users can see all the planted trees and they can also find tree repositories to go and get the one they want to plant.\r\n\r\n### Plant-Ent: enhance willingness!\r\n\r\nDetails: [https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/plant-ent](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/plant-ent)\r\n",
